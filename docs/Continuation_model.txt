title Async API threading model in PIC

loop Continuation model
state over Application: CreateStream (async)
note left of Application: Application thread calling PIC
PIC->PIC: Allocate and initialize internals
PIC->PIC: Step State machine to DescribeStream
PIC->CallbackProvider: DescribeStreamCallback
CallbackProvider->Networking: Schedule a DescribeStream call
note right of Networking: The call is handled by a Networking thread.
Networking->CallbackProvider: Successfully scheduled
CallbackProvider->PIC: Success
PIC->Application: Success
Networking->Networking: HTTP Call completed
Networking->CallbackProvider: DescribeStream completed
note left of CallbackProvider: The Networking has completed the call with a success or failure result.
CallbackProvider->PIC: DescribeStreamResult
PIC->PIC: Step the state machinery
note right of PIC: On failure of the call re-try. On success, if the stream is missing call CreateStream
PIC->CallbackProvider: CreateStreamCallback
CallbackProvider->Networking: Schedule CreateStream call
Networking->CallbackProvider: Success
CallbackProvider->PIC: Success
note right of PIC: The DescribeStreamResult Network thread returns.
PIC->CallbackProvider: DescribeStreamResult Success
CallbackProvider->Networking: Success, release thread
Networking->Networking: HTTP Call completed
Networking->CallbackProvider: CreateStream completed
note left of CallbackProvider: The Networking has completed the call with a success or failure result.
CallbackProvider->PIC: CreateStreamResult
PIC->PIC: Step the state machinery
note right of PIC: On failure of the call re-try. On success, move to Next state
PIC->CallbackProvider: TagStreamCallback
CallbackProvider->Networking: Schedule TagStream call
Networking->CallbackProvider: Success
CallbackProvider->PIC: Success
note right of PIC: The CreateStreamResult Network thread returns.
PIC->CallbackProvider: CreateStreamResult Success
CallbackProvider->Networking: Success, release thread
opt Iterating over the other states in a similar way
    PIC->CallbackProvider: Iterating over states/API calls
    CallbackProvider->Network:
    Network->CallbackProvider:
    CallbackProvider->PIC:
end
Networking->CallbackProvider: GetEndpointResult
CallbackProvider->PIC: GetEndpointResult (success)
state over PIC: STREAM_READY state
PIC->CallbackProvider: StreamReady callback
CallbackProvider->Application: Stream ready
Application->Application: Returning when CreateStreamSync API is called
