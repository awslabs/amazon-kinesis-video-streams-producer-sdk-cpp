### Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK C/C++
----
### Attention
----
If you are updating from any release before 1.7.0, you need to specify a track id for each Frame as shown in [sample](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/blob/master/kinesis-video-gst-demo/kinesis_video_gstreamer_sample_app.cpp#L312), otherwise you will get a 0x32000026 which means track not found.

----
### Introduction
----
Amazon Kinesis Video Streams makes it easy to securely stream video from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), and other processing.

Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK for C/C++ makes it easy to build an on-device application that securely connects to a video stream, and reliably publishes video and other media data to Kinesis Video Streams. It takes care of all the underlying tasks required to package the frames and fragments generated by the device's media pipeline. The SDK also handles stream creation, token rotation for secure and uninterrupted streaming, processing acknowledgements returned by Kinesis Video Streams, and other tasks.

### Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK for C/C++
----
Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK for C/C++ contains the following sub-directories/projects:
* kinesis-video-pic - The Platform Independent Codebase which is the basic building block for the C++/Java producer SDK. The project includes multiple sub-projects for each sub-component with unit tests.
* kinesis-video-producer - The C++ Producer SDK with unit test.
* kinesis-video-producer-jni - The C++ wrapper for JNI to expose the functionality to Java/Android.
* kinesis-video-gst-demo - C++ GStreamer sample application (for webcam, USB camera and RTSP) .
* kinesis-video-gstreamer-plugin - GStreamer plugin sink element (kvssink) and demo application.
* **kinesis-video-native-build** - Native build directory with a build script for **Mac OS/Linux/Raspberry PI/Windows**. This is the directory that will contain the artifacts **(executable binaries)** and JNI libraries after the build.
  * This should be your **current working directory** for running the install-scripts.

----

### Build and install Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK and sample applications
----
There are few build-time tools/dependencies which need to be installed in order to compile the core producer SDK libraries and the sample applications. Sample applications are provided to demonstrate _**how to send video**_ from **webcam**, **USB camera**, or **IP camera** (RTSP).

Please follow the **installation instructions** applicable to your operating system.
* Linux
  * **[Install instructions for Ubuntu and Raspberry PI](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/blob/master/install-instructions-linux.md)**

* stability fixes.

#### Release 1.7.0 (14th Dec 2018)
* Applications need to specify a trackId for every Frame as shown in create_kinesis_video_frame function in the samples
* Added support for uploading files(offline mode) to Kinesis Video Stream
* Additional fixes

#### Release 1.6.0 (3rd Dec 2018)
* JNI namespace change
* Improve kvssink plugin retry behavior
* Unify GetTimeFunc in C++ producer for override
* Support for custom user agent string

#### Release 1.5.1 (28th Sep 2018)
* Fragment Metadata Support for Producer SDK
* Add fallback frame rate to avoid negotiation issue on certain machines like macbook air

#### Release 1.5.0 (24th Aug 2018)
* Windows Support for Producer SDK
* Intermittent producer support
* Various bug fixes

#### Release 1.4.3 (20th June 2018)
* Added prebuilt docker images for AmazonLinux and Raspbian Stretch
* Updated install-script to accept commandline argument -j and pass the value to `make` to speed up building
* Updated install-script to accept commandline argument -d to remove opensource library installation files after finishing
* Updated CMakeLists.txt in kinesis-video-native-build to link up libraries properly

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<MYACCESSKEYID> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<MYSECRETKEY> ./kinesis_video_gstreamer_sample_rtsp_app <rtspurl> <stream-name>
```

#### Release 1.1.2 (January 2018)
* Allowed devices to output h.264 streams directly
* The user can also supply a streaming resolution through command line arguments.
  * If resolution is provided then the sample will try to check if the camera supports that resolution. If it does then streaming starts; else, it will fail with an error msg "Resolution not supported"
  * If no resolution is specified, the demo will try to use resolutions 1920x1080, 1280x720 and 640x480 in that order (highest resolution first)and will start streaming once the camera supported resolution is detected.
* Known issues:
  * When streaming on raspberry pi. Some green artifacts might be observed on the preview screen. Reducing the resolution can fix the issue.

#### Release 1.1.1 (December 2017)
* Fix USB webcam support
* Known issues:
    * If USB webcam doesn't support 720p, then gstreamer negotiation will fail. Trying lower resolution as mentioned in Troubleshooting may fix this issue.
